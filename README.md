This is a small GitHub action that is supposed to help me release stuff. Usually, I forget to do releases, so I built this.
The bot runs [semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) and creates pull requests
[like this one](https://github.com/sebbo2002/ical-generator/pull/240) when there is something to release.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Example

```yaml
name: ReleaseBot
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: ['develop']
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 0'

jobs:
  release-bot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ‚òÅÔ∏è Checkout Project
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: ü§ñ Run ReleaseBot
        uses: @sebbo2002/release-bot

```
